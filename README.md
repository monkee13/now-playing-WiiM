# What's WiiMing

A Fork of Tom Z's "Now Playing". Thank you Tom for getting me started down this path

An project to make a "What's WiiMing" digital frame to show what is playing from my WiiM Pro Plus audio streamer.

I got the idea because I have a What's Playing frame to put record covers on when I play vinyl and when I am streaming songs to that same setup I need to pull up my phone see what the track is. I figured there should be a way to just look up at the system see it like an old school album cover. 

This will be my journey down the path of learning to code again after a few decades (a lot has changed).
